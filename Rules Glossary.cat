      <description>**OBSCURED TARGETS**
Once it has been established that the target is Visible, the opposing Admiral then checks to see whether the active model’s Visibility is Obscured.


Visibility is Obscured if it is not possible to trace a straight line from the Centre Point of the active model to every part of the Target model without passing through at least one other model or Terrain Feature.


These other models or Terrain Features are Obscuring the active model’s Visibility.


When a model is Participating in an Attack action, and its Visibility is Obscured, the opposing Admiral adds Bonus Dice to their Resistance Pool equal to the Mass of the largest Obscuring model or Terrain Feature, making the attack less effective. 


The opposing Admiral does this for every Participating model whose Visibility is Obscured.</description>

For the purposes of determining  visibility, its Mass rating is increased by the Island’s Mass.
In addition, it does not suffer any Damage as a result of the Breach Critical Damage Effect in its Consolidation Step.

      <description>**RESOLVING AN ATTACK RUN MISSION**
An SRS Stack that is Threatening an enemy unit performs an Attack Run mission, using the following process.


1. NOMINATE ATTACK RUN TARGETS
The active Admiral nominates models in the enemy unit to be Attack Run Targets. 
The maximum number of Attack Run Targets they can nominate is equal to the number of SRS tokens in their Stack


2. MAKE AN ACTION ROLL
The active Admiral makes a single Action Roll regardless of the number of Attack Run Targets and the opposing Admiral makes a single Resistance Roll:


&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Each SRS token in the Stack adds a number of Action Dice equal to its Attack rating.  &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Each Attack Run Target adds a number of dice equal to its Defences rating.
Add 1 Bonus Die for each Escort token
accompanying the target unit. &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;The highest Armour rating among the Targets.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


3. ALLOCATE CRITICAL DAMAGE
For each Success scored in the Action Roll, the active Admiral rolls a Critical Damage Die.


They then allocate each Critical Damage Die to an Attack Run Target, or to an Escort token accompanying the Target unit. 
Only one die can be allocated to each Attack Run Target.


4. RESOLVE CRITICAL DAMAGE
Each Attack Run Target that has a die allocated to it suffers the matching Critical Damage Effect.


Each Escort token that has a die allocated to it is discarded.


5. DISENGAGE
Discard all SRS tokens (friendly or enemy) allocated to the Target unit. 




**INTERCEPTING ATTACK RUNS**
If an Admiral resolves an Attack Run mission  against an enemy unit that is Supported by an SRS Stack, the opposing Admiral makes an Interception Attempt. 


This is resolved before the active Admiral nominates Attack Run Targets.


The opposing Admiral makes an Action Roll. There is no Resistance Roll.


&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Each SRS token in the Supporting Stack adds a number of Action Dice equal to its Intercept rating.  &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;The Stack’s Resilience rating.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


For each Success scored in the Action Roll, one SRS token is discarded from the SRS Stack making the Attack Run. If this results in the last token in the Stack being discarded, the Attack Run mission ends.


**INTERCEPTING MIXED STACKS**
If an Interception Attempt is resolved against an SRS Stack composed of two or more different types of SRS token, the Resolve Outcomes step of the Action Roll is carried out a little differently than normal.


First, the active Admiral selects one type of squadron from their Stack.
The opposing Admiral groups the Hits according to that squadron type’s Resilience rating. In this way, the active Admiral can attempt to screen a high Attack squadron with a high Resilience squadron. 


For each Success, one token of the chosen type is discarded.
If, after every token of this squadron type is removed, there are still Hits remaining in the Action Roll, the active Admiral chooses another squadron type from the Stack. 


The process is repeated using that squadron type’s Resilience rating until either there are no Hits left in the Action Roll scoring Successes or there are no SRS tokens left in the Stack.</description>

      <description>This is a Generator.

A Cryogenic Blast is a Special Action which can be made by any unit that contains at least one model with a Cryo Generator system. 

**RESOLVING A CRYOGENIC BLAST ACTION**
When a unit makes a Cryogenic Blast action, its Admiral uses the following process.


1. CHOOSE TARGET
The Admiral chooses one of the following:
• An enemy Surface model.
• A specific point of Open Water that is at least
1” away from any models, Markers or Terrain Features. (Mark this point with a Generator Effect token).
• An Iceberg with a Mass lower than 5.


2. NOMINATING PARTICIPATING MODELS
The Admiral nominates any number of models in the active unit that will Participate in the action. A model can only Participate if it has a Cryo Generator, it is within 10” of the Target, and the Target is Visible to it. (For the purposes of determining if a point of Open Water is Visible, it is treated as having a Mass rating of 0.)
If no models can Participate, another Target must be chosen.


3. MAKE THE CRYOGENIC BLAST ROLL
The active Admiral rolls a number of Action Dice equal to the total Mass ratings of all Participating models.
Each Heavy Strike and Exploding Strike rolled scores one Success. (Note that this is not an Action Roll, so Exploding Strikes do not allow additional dice to be rolled.)
If no Successes are scored, the Action ends.


4. RESOLVE OUTCOME
The outcome of the Cryogenic Blast roll depends on the
target that was chosen.


ENEMY SURFACE MODEL
For each Success that was scored, the target suffers 1 Critical Damage.


OPEN WATER
The active Admiral replaces the Generator Effect token with an Iceberg. Its Mass cannot exceed the number of Successes rolled.
The Iceberg must be placed within 1” of the Generator Effect token, and not within Proximity of any models or other Terrain Features.


ICEBERG
The Iceberg’s Mass is increased by 1 for each Success, up to a maximum Mass of 5.</description>

This takes the form of a straight line, drawn between the Centre Points of the two models, and has a Strength equal to the highest Mass rating of the two models.


A single model can generate multiple Energy Walls, provided it is within 5” of multiple eligible models. 


Whenever an enemy unit makes an Attack action, trace a straight line from the Centre Point of each Participating Model to the Centre Point of the Initial Target. For each line that passes through an Energy Wall, add Bonus Dice equal to the Energy Wall’s Strength to the Resistance Roll.


Energy Walls that are connected to the Initial Target are disregarded. If the line passes through multiple Energy Walls, the Energy Wall with the highest Strength is
counted.

      <description>This is a Generator.

This model’s unit can make a Magma Sear Special Action.

A Magma Sear is a Special Action which can be made by any unit that contains at least one model with a Magma Cast Generator system.


When a unit makes a Magma Sear action, its Admiral uses the following process.


1. NOMINATE PARTICIPATING MODELS
The Admiral nominates any number of models in the active unit that will Participate in the action. A model can only Participate if it has a Magma Cast Generator.


2. MAKE THE MAGMA SEAR ROLL
The active Admiral rolls a number of Action Dice equal to the number of Participating models. Then, they choose one die, and discard the others. This die will determine the Magma Mass rating and Eruption Range, which are used in the following steps.


If all of the dice result in Blanks, the action ends immediately.

    &lt;td&gt;10&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


3. CREATE OR EXPAND A MAGMA FORMATION
The active Admiral chooses one of the following options:


CREATE NEW MAGMA FORMATION
The Admiral places a Magma Formation in the Play Area. 
It must have a Mass rating value that matches the Magma Mass rating, and it must be placed so that it is within the Eruption Range of at least one Participating model.


A Magma Formation cannot be placed in contact with another Terrain feature, a model or a marker. 

EXPAND EXISTING MAGMA FORMATION
The admiral chooses an existing Magma Formation that is within the Eruption Range of at least one Participating model.


That Formation’s Mass is increased by the Magma Mass rating, to a maximum of 4. 




4. RESOLVE MAGMA ERUPTIONS
Each model (friend or foe) that is within Proximity of the Magma Formation that was Created or Expanded is targeted by a Magma Eruption.
The active Admiral makes a single Action Roll, with no Resistance Roll. The Resolve Outcomes step is resolved separately for each target model. 


&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ACTION&lt;br&gt;POOL&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;6 Action Dice, plus additional dice equal to the Mass of the Magma Formation. &lt;br&gt;For example, if the Magma Formation has a Mass of 3, the Action Pool consists of 9 dice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;SUCCESS&lt;br&gt;THRESHOLD&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;The Armour rating of the Target Model.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Each Target Model suffers 1 Damage for each Success scored in its Resolve Outcomes step. Any model that suffers at least 1 Damage also gains a level of Disorder and a Structural Failure Critical Damage Effect.</description>

*If the Admiral wishes one or more Crippled models to Participate in an SRS Launch, they must make a Group Crew Check, in the same way as if they wanted Crippled models to Participate in an Action.*

**LAUNCHING SHORT RANGE SQUADRONS**
On an Admiral’s turn, they nominate one of their units in the Play Area that contains one or more Carrier models, and resolve an SRS
Launch using the process below. A unit cannot be nominated if it has already resolved an SRS Launch this Round.


1. DECLARE PARTICIPATING MODELS
The Admiral declares which models in the active unit will Participate in the launch. 
A model cannot Participate if it does not have a Property that allows it to launch SRS tokens, or if it is otherwise prevented from launching SRS tokens.


2. CREATE SRS STACK(S)
Each Participating model launches a number of SRS tokens, as determined by the Property that allows it to do so.
The Admiral arranges these launched SRS tokens into any number of SRS Stacks. 
There is no upper or lower limit to the number of tokens in a stack, or to the number of separate Stacks launched from a single Carrier.


3. CHOOSE SRS MISSION(S)
For each SRS Stack, the Admiral chooses one of the following SRS Missions: 


**ATTACK RUN MISSION**
Allocate the SRS Stack to an enemy unit within 30” of the model from which it is being launched. It is now Threatening that unit.
When this Mission is resolved, it will potentially inflict Critical Damage on models in the enemy unit or destroy the unit’s Escorts.


**AIR SUPPORT MISSION**
Allocate the SRS Stack to a friendly unit within 30” of the model from which it is being launched. It is now Supporting that unit.


This Mission is not resolved at the start of an Activation. Instead, the Stack can provide Air Support if the friendly unit is targeted by an
Attack action or Boarding action, and can make an Interception Attempt if the friendly unit is targeted by an Attack Run mission.


**MINE CLEARANCE MISSION**
Allocate the SRS Stack to a Minefield marker12 within 30” of the model from which it is being launched.  It is now Sweeping that Minefield marker.
When this Mission is resolved, it will potentially Clear13 the Minefield marker and other Minefield markers within 5” of it.




**MISSING TARGETS**
If an SRS Stack’s Target is removed from play (for example, if the last model in a friendly unit which it is Supporting Withdraws or is Destroyed), the Stack is placed to one side (for example, at one edge of the Play Area). 


In the End Phase, all Short Range Squadrons that have been set aside will perform Aerial Reconnaissance.</description>

      <description>4. THE CONSOLIDATION STEP
In this step, each model in the unit Rallies if it is able to do so.




CRITICAL DAMAGE EFFECTS
Some Critical Damage Effects are resolved in the Consolidation
Step of a unit’s Activation. These Effects are resolved after the
unit has had the chance to Rally.


RALLYING A MODEL
A model can Rally as long as it meets the following criteria:
• The model is not Breaking Coherency.
• The model is not within Proximity3 of a Terrain Feature.
• The model is not within Proximity of a model in a different unit
(friendly or enemy).
When a model Rallies, it loses a level of Disorder, plus an additional level of Disorder for each Action that its unit did not use in the preceding Action Step.


For example, a unit has an Action Limit rating of 3. During its Action Step, it makes two Attack actions, but does not make a third Action. 


In the Consolidation Step, each model that can Rally loses 2 levels of Disorder.


CHAOS!
A model cannot Rally if its unit contains one or more Crippled models.</description>

1. EXPLODE

      <description>**MAKING CREW CHECKS**
Victory &amp; Valour Cards are also used to make Crew Checks.
Whenever the rules instruct an Admiral to make a Crew Check for a model, they draw, reveal, and then discard the top card from their deck.
 If the card’s Value is higher than the model’s Crew rating, the check fails. Otherwise, the check passes.


**AUTOMATIC PASSES**
Some rules allow a unit to automatically pass Crew Checks. Where this is the case, no card is drawn - the unit simply counts as passing.


**VOLUNTARY FAILURE**
Instead of making a Crew Check, an Admiral can choose to fail it. No card is drawn - the unit simply counts as failing.


**GROUP CREW CHECKS**
Some rules require a Group Crew Check. This is made in the same way as a standard Crew Check, but is made for multiple models at once.
A Group Crew Check uses the lowest Crew rating from among the models for which it is being made, taking any Modifiers into account.


**BROKEN SPIRIT**
If an Admiral’s Victory &amp; Valour deck runs out, this represents their Force’s spirit being broken. The time for claiming minor victories
and enacting heroic acts of valour has passed.
The Admiral immediately shuffles their Discard Pile and places it face-down to create a new Deck.
For the rest of the game, they can no longer draw cards from the Deck into their Hand. Cards can still be drawn to resolve Crew Checks, but their supply of Valour Effects and Minor Victories has run dry, and they risk having to Surrender the Initiative every Round.</description>

      <description>If a moving model Collides with an enemy model after moving at least 3”, and the point of contact between the two models is in the moving model’s Fore arc, the active Admiral can declare a Ram.


A model can only attempt a Ram during its own Movement Step.


RESOLVING A RAM
When an Admiral declares a Ram, they follow the steps outlined below. 


During this process, the moving model is referred to as the Ramming Model, and the other model as the Target.




1. Make a Crew Check
The Admiral makes a Crew Check for the Ramming Model.
If the check fails, the Ram is unsuccessful and a normal Collision is resolved.
If the check passes, continue to the next step.


2. Inflict Disorder
Both the Ramming Model and the Target gain 1 level of Disorder.


3. Make an Action Roll
The active Admiral makes an Action Roll. There is no Resistance Roll.
The Resolve Outcomes step of this Action Roll is resolved twice - once for the Target model, and once for the Ramming model. 


&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Add a number of Action Dice equal to
the Ramming Model’s Hull rating. Add 1 Bonus Die for each full inch the model moved before the Ram. This cannot add more than 5 Bonus Dice. &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Threshold (Target Model)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;The Target Model’s Mass rating.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Threshold (Ramming Model)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;The Ramming Model’s Mass rating.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


4. Inflict Damage
Each model suffers 1 Damage for each Success scored in its Resolve Outcomes step.


5. Disengage
The target model moves 1” directly backwards. If it comes into contact with another model or Terrain Feature, it stops moving, but no Collision is resolved.


**CONSEQUENCES OF RAMMING**
If a model attempts a Ram during its Movement Step, it cannot Participate in any Actions in the subsequent Action Step - even if the Crew Check fails and the Ram is resolved as a Collision.</description>

Count Hits step.


In addition, if a model in this unit moves into Proximity with a Minefield marker, it can gain 1 level of Disorder to attempt to Repel the mines. 


If it does, roll an Action Die. 
If a Blank is rolled, the Minefield is Triggered as normal.


On any other result, remove the Marker from the Play Area and, at the end of the model’s move, place it within 3” of the moving model, wholly within its Fore Arc.

    </rule>
    <rule name="Disorder" id="538e-a8c9-c812-2ab8" hidden="false">
      <description>**GAINING DISORDER**
In addition to Damage, models can gain up to 3 levels of Disorder.
This represents a loss of cohesion among a vessel’s crew, whether from stressful situations, physical harm or environmental peril.


A model’s current Disorder level is, like Damage, tracked on a model by-model basis, by placing a Disorder token in contact with the
model. 
If a model has no Disorder, it does not need a token.


Disorder is not permanent in the same way as Damage, but cannot be removed unless a rule specifically allows it. 
The most common way for a model to lose levels of Disorder is by Rallying at the end of
its Activation.


**EFFECTS OF DISORDER**
A Disordered model is subject to various penalties, depending on the level of Disorder it has: 

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demoralised All Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Each level of Disorder a model has imposes a -1 Modifier on its Crew rating.
*For example, a model with a Crew rating of 7 has 2 levels of Disorder, so its Crew rating is treated as being 5.*   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panicking Level 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;If an Action Roll is made for a model with 2 levels of Disorder, any Heavy Strikes in the roll are Converted to Standard Strikes after Re-rolls have been resolved. 
&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutinous Level 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;If an Action Roll is made for a model with 3 levels of Disorder, any Heavy and Exploding Strikes in the roll are Converted to Standard Strikes after Re-rolls have been resolved. If the model makes a Full Reverse or Emergency Manoeuvre, it gains a point of Damage instead of a level of Disorder. &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

If an Action Roll is made for more than one model at a time (for example, when resolving an Attack action in which multiple models are Participating), the highest level of Disorder among the models is used. 


**OTHER DISORDER EFFECTS**
When making a Broadside Roll for a Target, if at least one contributing model has 2 Levels of Disorder, Heavy Strikes only inflict 1 Damage.


If at least one contributing model has 3 Levels
of Disorder, Heavy and Exploding Strikes only inflict 1 Damage.


When a Carrier unit resolves an SRS Launch, each level of Disorder on a model in the unit reduces the number of SRS tokens it can launch by 1. 


**SPREADING DISORDER**
A model cannot have more than 3 levels of Disorder.


If a rule would cause a model to gain a fourth level of Disorder, it Spreads to the closest friendly model within 4”, which gains 1 level of Disorder. If the closest friendly model already has 3 levels of Disorder, it does not Spread and there is no effect.


If two models are equally close, Disorder Spreads to the one with the lowest Disorder level. If this is still tied, the opposing Admiral chooses which model it Spreads to.</description>

      <description>**RESOLVING A BROADSIDE ACTION**
Broadside actions let units bring their close-range flank batteries to bear with devastating effect. 
A unit can only make one Broadside action per Activation.
When a unit makes a Broadside action, use the following process:




1. NOMINATE PARTICIPATING MODELS
The Admiral nominates any number of models in the active unit that will Participate in the action.


2. CHOOSE A TARGET
The Admiral chooses an enemy model to be a Target of the Broadside.


3. DETERMINE CONTRIBUTING BATTERIES
The Admiral determines which models’ flank batteries are Contributing to the action.
A model’s flank batteries are Contributing to the action if it is Participating in the action, and all of the following criteria are met: 
• The Target has the same Positional Trait  as the model.
• The Target is within the model’s Port or Starboard Arc.
• The Target is within 4” of the model.
• The Target is Visible to the model, and is not Obscured.


If no models’ flank batteries are Contributing to the action, the Admiral must either choose a different Target or end the action.


4. MAKE THE BROADSIDE ROLL
The Admiral rolls a number of Action Dice equal to the total Broadside ratings of all models whose flank batteries are Contributing
to the Action.
The Target suffers 1 Damage for each Standard Strike that is rolled, and 2 Damage for each Heavy Strike and Exploding Strike. (Note that this is not an Action Roll, so Exploding Strikes do not allow
additional dice to be rolled.)
In addition, if the Target suffers at least 1 Damage, it also gains 1 level
of Disorder.


5. RESOLVE ADDITIONAL TARGETS
The Admiral repeats stages 2 to 4 as many times as they wish.
Each enemy model can only be chosen to be the Target once per Broadside action.</description>

    <rule name="Boarding" id="7b6a-6ffe-da10-c9a7" hidden="false">
      <description>**RESOLVING A BOARDING ACTION**
Boarding actions represent daring raids on
enemy vessels to strike at
vital weak points.


A unit can only make a Boarding action if it has a Property that specifically allows it to do so. When a unit makes a Boarding action, use the following process:


1. CHOOSE TARGET
The Admiral chooses an enemy model to be the Target. 
This model must be within 4” of at least one model in the active unit. 
Most Properties that allow a unit to launch a Boarding action only allow it to target enemy models with specific Positional Traits.


2. NOMINATE PARTICIPATING MODELS
The Admiral nominates any number of models in the active unit that will Participate in the action. A model cannot Participate if it is further than 4” from the Target, or if it has already Participated in a Boarding action during this Action Step.


3. MAKE THE ACTION ROLL
The active Admiral makes an Action Roll, and the opposing Admiral makes a Resistance Roll:


&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Each Participating model adds a number of Action Dice as determined by the Property that permits Boarding actions.  &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;The Resistance Pool starts with a number of dice equal to the Target’s Defences rating. Add 1 die for each Escort token accompanying the Target’s unit.
If there is an SRS Stack Supporting the Target unit, the opposing Admiral can discard any number of tokens from the Stack. Each discarded token adds a number of dice equal to the Stack’s Support rating.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;The Target’s Crew rating.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


4. RESOLVE OUTCOMES
The target suffers a Critical Damage Effect for each Success scored in the Action Roll. Instead of rolling Critical Damage Dice, however, the active Admiral can choose the specific Effects that are applied, representing the extremely targeted nature of such actions.


Additionally, unless the Action Roll scores no Successes (either because the active Admiral rolled no Strikes, or because all Hits in the Action Pool were negated by the Resistance Roll) the target gains 1 level of Disorder.</description>

In a Collision, the moving model immediately gains 1 level of Disorder. If it has Collided with another model, that model also gains 1 level of Disorder unless its Mass rating is higher than the moving model’s Mass.


If the moving model has Collided with a Terrain Feature, or with a model whose Mass is greater than its own, its Admiral rolls a number of Action Dice equal to the moving model’s Mass. 


The moving model suffers 1 Damage for each Strike (of any kind) that they roll.


In its next Activation, a model that has been involved in a Collision might not be able to move forwards without another Collision occurring.


This can usually be avoided by making a Full Reverse to move backwards instead

If this model is Destroyed, replace it with four Wreck markers. The first is positioned over the Centre Point of the model. This model’s Admiral then places the remaining three Markers, so that each is within 1” of the first, and none are in contact with any Markers, models, or Terrain Features. Any Markers that cannot be placed in accordance with these rules are not placed.</description>

    <rule name="Interphase Generator" id="594f-ba0c-7dbe-968c" hidden="false">
      <description>This is a Generator. 


Its effect cannot be conferred to another unit via the Generator Ship property.


If every model in a unit has an Interphase Generator, its Admiral can declare that it will Interphase at the end of its Consolidation Step. 
Mark the unit with a Special Effect token.



All of the models in the unit are Interphasing until the start of the unit’s next Activation.

In the subsequent Round, an Admiral must Activate any Interphasing units in their Force before they activate any units that are not Interphasing.

An Interphasing model cannot be targeted by any Actions, rules or effects, and cannot gain Damage, Critical Damage or Disorder by any means. 


It cannot Block Visibility (though it can still Obscure it as normal) and any Properties and Systems it may have other than Interphase Generator are ignored. 


Surface models can Pass Through an Interphasing model, but if they do so, they gain 1 level of Disorder.

In an Interphasing unit’s Movement Step, each model’s Maximum Speed rating is doubled, they treat all Terrain Features and Environmental Features as Open Water, they can Pass Through all other models, and are unaffected by Markers of any kind. 


They cannot Come About, but at the end of the move they can freely rotate around their Centre Point to face any direction. 
No model can end its move in contact with a Terrain Feature, model or Marker.

At the end of the Movement Step, the Special Effect token is removed, and each other model, friend or foe, that one or more models in the active unit Passed Through gains 1 level of Disorder.

In the subsequent Action Step, the unit’s Action Limit is reduced to 1.
It cannot Interphase again in its Consolidation step if it was Interphased at the start of its Activation.</description>

      <description>After resolving this Attack action (including the Under Fire rule), the opposing Admiral makes a Crew Check for the Initial Target. 


If the Check fails, the Initial Target gains a Hazard Critical Damage Effect, and is marked with a Negative Effect token.


The Negative Effect token is removed in the Clean Up step of the End Phase. Until then, this quality is disregarded when resolving Attack actions against the model with the Token.</description>
